<h1>LLVM IR Experimental Development</h1>
<h3>Feb 10, 2009 - Initial Revision</h3>

<h3>[john@paik Tue Feb 10 12:54:50 2009]</h3>

This area contains a git working tree against a git svn cloned LLVM
repo.
<br>
Development projects are source-controlled within git, with the
possibility for pushing to LLVM at a later date (using patches,
of course).
